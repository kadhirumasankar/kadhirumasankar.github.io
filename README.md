# Kadhir's Website

I made this website to showcase my projects. It has a **My Work** tab where visitors can see all my projects, and an **About Me** tab with my contact information. Some cards can be expanded to read more information about those projects. There are also links to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kadhirus99/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kadhirumasankar) profiles.
